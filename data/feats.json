You can also adjust your height and weight but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of an individual you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have; if your new form does not have wings, you cannot use the flying speed granted by Mischief. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait.",
